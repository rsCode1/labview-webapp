## üìå Overview

This repository showcases the **LabView Dashboard**, a full-stack web application designed and developed during my student position at Intel. The application enhances the efficiency and reliability of processor stress-testing by providing real-time monitoring, dynamic visualization, and streamlined data analysis. Codeless repository.
---

## üí° Motivation

During processor stress-testing at Intel, significant challenges were identified:

- **Tester malfunctions** causing prolonged downtime.
- **Delayed monitoring**, preventing real-time response.
- **Inefficient resource planning** due to the absence of clear visual insights.

The LabView Dashboard addresses these issues, significantly improving response times, recovery from failures, and planning efficiency.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time log analysis:** Continuously parses vast log data, extracting critical metrics instantly.
- **Dynamic visualization:** Presents intuitive dashboards to track test progress.
- **Anomaly detection:** Quickly identifies overstressed CPUs and test anomalies.
- **Efficient planning:** Provides accurate estimates for improved resource allocation.
- **User-tailored Interface:** Accessible by engineers, technicians, and management.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular, ngx-charts
- **Backend:** C# (.NET Worker Service)
- **Database:** MariaDB
- **API:** RESTful API (C#)

---

## üîß System Architecture

The system is structured into three primary layers:

1. **Worker Service:**
   - Copies and combines logs.
   - Parses essential metrics and detects anomalies.
   - Uploads processed data into MariaDB.

2. **Backend/API:**
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints for data access.

3. **Frontend (Angular):**
   - Displays real-time test metrics and results.
   - Utilizes interactive charts and cards for visualization.
